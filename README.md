Enrise Psr\Log extension
=================

This repository contains an extension on the `LoggerAwareTrait` that comes with the `Psr\Log` package.
It contains convenience methods to use the `LoggerAwareInterface` implementation in a safe way. Meaning you don't have 
to care whether the class you're implementing actually has a logger instance attached to it.
